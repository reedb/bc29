Most BC29 problems occur because the conformal coating fails and the
board is in an unsealed box, so water condenses on it, causes a
short circuit, and burns out either some trace on the board or the
resistor in the input power cable.  So you replace the resistor or
bypass the burnt trace, and often the problem is fixed.  If so, you
reapply the coating to prevent repetitions.  If not, then it's time for
more technical debugging. -Ken Olum

From the Yahoo solectria_ev site (files section) The following should be reviewed:
"AH Control Board Removal.pdf" (covers late model with separate remote display)
"Amp-Hour Repair.pdf"

All scope screen captures with 10mVDC applied to SHUNT+ and SHUNT-.

The amp hour meter has five major components to it:

1. High accuracy V/F circuit (~25000:1 accuracy, 250A to 0.01A). It 
   uses a very low input leakage, chopper stabilized op amp and a trimmed 
   RC. This requires a highly stable capacitor and 0.1% resistors. 
   Delta-Sigma charge balancing voltage to frequency converter.
2. AH Counter
3. LCD driver
4. Battery voltage to 5VDC regulator
5. A 32 KHz clock/counter (IC: 4060) that is used to create the -4VDC used by the operational amplifiers.

In the 5VDC regulator portion of the circuit, a IRF720 is the pass 
device in a very sophisticated multi-stage regulator and filter for the 
transient sensitive CMOS IC's used in the circuit. The meter circuitry 
only draws about 1 ma of current at very well regulated 5 volts. It is 
derived, not from the 12 DC to DC convertor buss, but is regulated down 
from the full, raw, battery voltage with all of the high voltage noise 
and regen voltage variations, etc. The unit will power up with as 
little as 12VDC applied to +BATT.

C2 is omitted for 200A range.

In the area of the IRF720 is also a very low (idle) current regulator 
(IC: LP2951D) for the final 5 volts regulation, which follows a 
pre-regulator stage with a simple series pass type of regulator (IRF 
720 ). A simple zener diode controls the IRF720 output voltage to the 
final regulator (double stage regulator with filtering). 

The LCD interface is a hybrid affair consisting of driving some 
segments directly (MSD one, minus sign, decimal point and colon) and a 
clock/direction interface for the main count. The LCD module outputs a 
45 Hz square wave to facilitate driving the direct segments. To make a 
segment visible, this square wave is inverted and applied to the 
segment line.
